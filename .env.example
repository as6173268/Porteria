# 2. Never expose your service_role key in the client
# 3. Keep your GitHub token secure - it has write access to the repository
# 3. All sensitive operations should be handled server-side with RLS policies
# 4. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
# 5. Use Supabase Auth for user authentication
# 6. Validate all inputs on both client and server side
